## 👋 Introduction

GitHub Finder is a web application that helps users retrieve information about their GitHub statistics, which dynamically change with their profile activity.

## 🔨 What does it do?

GitHubUG contains a search feature that searches for all the Github users using the text entered by the user. It displays the users whose username fully or partially matches with the entered text.
This GitHubUG differs from others in the sense that, it not only shows the basic information of that GitHub user account but also shows their activities, contributions, commits, pull requests and overall profile score.
